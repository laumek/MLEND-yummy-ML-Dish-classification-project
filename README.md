# MLEND-yummy-ML-Dish-classification-project

**MLEnd Yummy Dataset Contribution**

I contributed to the MLEnd Yummy Dataset project by adding images of 16 delicious dishes I enjoyed. I captured top-view photos of each dish before savouring them and completed a spreadsheet with the dish attributes (dish name, ingredients, restaurant, cuisine, ratings...). All contributions amounted to a final dataset comprising 3250 dish images up to date. It was a delightful experience that made me understand better the process of data creation and collection. The aim of this collective effort is to establish an inclusive and widely accessible dataset, fostering global opportunities for learning and research. Feel free to explore and contribute to this rich dataset! 🍽️📸


The MLEnd Yummy Dataset project encompasses two main components, each addressed in separate Jupyter notebooks:

🍟🍚 **Rice or  Chips ? (Basic Component)**

The basic problem we want to solve here is predicting if an input image contains rice or dish. The ML pipeline includes data import, preprocessing, and feature extraction as well as the implementations of 3 models: Logistic Regression, SVC and Random Forest Classifier. All would be evaluated using different metrics to distinguish the model’s capacity to discern between rice or chips dishes.


🥑 **Healthiness rating (Advanced Component)**

Here, the 🌱advanced problem is to predict a dish healthiness score using dish attributes (name, ingredients) and nutritional information obtained from food-linked APIs and web scraping. When an image is inputted, relevant attributes are extracted and a healthiness prediction is made. The predictions will then be compared with existing ratings for very similar dishes for evaluation and discussion around model accuracy and user perceptions of dish healthiness.
